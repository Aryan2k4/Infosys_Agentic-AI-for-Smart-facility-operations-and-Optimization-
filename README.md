## 📌 Overview

**FacilityOps** is a full-stack agentic AI system that autonomously monitors, analyzes, and optimizes a smart facility across five operational domains — **Energy, Maintenance, Occupancy, Security, and Cost** — and rolls all five up into a single **Facility Intelligence Engine**.

This isn't a dashboard with an LLM chat bolted on. Every domain agent follows the same rigorous four-stage template (`analyze → recommend → investigate → run`), backed by genuinely trained ML models and real agentic tool-calling — where the model is handed a goal and a set of tools, and decides for itself what to call, in what order, and when to hand a finding off to another agent.

> **Submission scope:** Milestones 1–4, fully implemented. All five agents, the ML pipeline, the agentic tool-calling layer, and all six dashboards (five domain dashboards + one Executive Overview) are built and tested — **59/59 tests passing**.

### Why this project is different

| | What most "AI dashboards" do | What FacilityOps does |
|---|---|---|
| **ML** | One model, cherry-picked metrics | 4 domains, multiple models compared per domain, evaluated against naive baselines and cross-validation, with *honest* results reported even when a model underperforms |
| **"Agentic"** | A single LLM call that narrates pre-computed data | The model is given real tools and decides the call sequence itself — branching on intermediate results, not a fixed script |
| **Cross-agent collaboration** | Independent features bolted together | Agents genuinely hand work off to each other (e.g. Energy → Maintenance, Occupancy → Security) via shared backend functions, not just UI links |
| **Data honesty** | Synthetic data presented as real | Every dataset's real vs. derived vs. synthetic composition is disclosed in-code and in this README — nothing is dressed up |

```

Every agent follows the same four-step template:

```
__init__()  →  analyze()  →  recommend()  →  run()
```

...plus an `investigate()` path where an LLM is given **tools, not answers**, and reasons through a multi-step investigation autonomously. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design rationale and how it extends without rewrites.

### Three distinct AI/decision layers (not just one)

| Layer | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Rule-based** | Deterministic heuristics — fast, explainable, always available | `EnergyAgent.recommend()` — 7 rule checks |
| **2. ML forecasting/detection** | Actual trained models, cross-validated, benchmarked against naive baselines | Multi-horizon energy forecasting, RUL prediction, anomaly detection |
| **3. Agentic investigation** | The model is given tools and decides the call sequence itself, branching on intermediate results | `/investigate` endpoints — real multi-step tool-use, not a fixed checklist |

## 🗂 Milestones

<details>
<summary><b>Milestone 1 — Energy Intelligence & Monitoring</b> (Weeks 1–2) ✅</summary>

- **Energy Agent** (`analyze → recommend → run`) ingests utility/IoT data and runs consumption analytics: totals/peaks, HVAC/Lighting/Plug/Other breakdown, trend detection, per-hour anomaly detection (z-score), phantom-load ratio, temperature and occupancy correlation.
- **7 rule-based recommendations** with estimated savings %.
- **ML forecasting** — three *separately trained* models (1h / 6h / 24h horizons), each comparing Linear Regression / Random Forest / Gradient Boosting against two naive baselines, validated with a time-ordered holdout **and** 5-fold `TimeSeriesSplit`. Results reported as-is: 1h/6h models beat baseline by ~65–67%; the 24h model only marginally (~5%), surfaced honestly as `confidence: low` rather than hidden.
- **LLM briefing** — synthesizes the Energy Agent's structured analysis into a plain-English summary for a facility manager. Provider-agnostic (`MockProvider` / `GroqProvider` / `GeminiProvider`), with graceful fallback to Mock if a real key is missing.
- **Agentic investigation** (`/api/energy/investigate`) — the model is given 7 real tools (consumption summary, submeter breakdown, anomaly detection, temperature correlation, occupancy correlation, horizon-aware ML forecast, maintenance-flagging handoff) and decides which to call. Genuine branching: the 24h forecast is only checked if the 1h forecast shows a ≥8% shift; temperature correlation only if HVAC is a large load share.
- **Data**: three real public datasets combined onto a shared 15-min timeline — PJM Interconnection grid load (rescaled), Environment Canada hourly weather, UCI Occupancy Detection dataset. Composite nature fully disclosed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Milestone 2 — Predictive Maintenance</b> (Weeks 3–4) ✅</summary>

- **Maintenance Agent**, same four-step template — proves the architecture generalizes.
- **Data**: NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation dataset (FD001), real sensor measurements run to actual mechanical failure, relabeled (disclosed) onto fictional facility assets.
- **ML model**: RUL (Remaining Useful Life) prediction. Compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Histogram Gradient Boosting, and a blended ensemble — **ensemble won**, MAE **14.47 cycles** (R² 0.753) vs. a naive baseline of 34.83 cycles (**58.5% improvement**). Ships with an 80% prediction interval (empirical coverage: 80.0%), evaluated on NASA's own held-out 100-engine test set.
- **Agentic investigation** (`/maintenance/investigate`) with real tools: fleet-wide health check, single-asset check, at-risk asset listing, work-order creation.
- **Cross-agent handoff**: the Energy Agent's maintenance-flagging tool now calls the *same* `open_work_order()` function the Maintenance Agent uses internally — a real row lands in the database tagged `source="energy_agent"`, visually distinguished in the UI. First proof of genuine agent cooperation in the codebase.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Milestone 3 — Occupancy & Security Intelligence</b> (Weeks 5–6) ✅</summary>

**Occupancy Agent**
- Classifier trained directly on the UCI Occupancy Detection dataset (real minute-level ambient sensor data + ground-truth photo labels), evaluated on UCI's own two held-out test splits.
- Logistic Regression beat Gradient Boosting: **98.25% accuracy** (F1 0.964) vs. a 75.7% naive baseline.
- Live 8-zone fleet (offices, meeting rooms, cafeteria, lobby, server room, executive wing) — real time-of-day profile projected per zone with independent noise (disclosed synthetic step).

**Security Agent**
- Fully synthetic, disclosed dataset (no license-clear real access-control dataset exists publicly) with deliberately injected, labeled anomalies for honest evaluation.
- **Isolation Forest** (unsupervised, live scorer): precision 0.714, recall 0.738, **F1 0.726**. A **Local Outlier Factor** model kept as a second opinion. A **supervised RandomForest reference** (F1 0.706) shows how much accuracy the unsupervised constraint costs — the unsupervised model edges it out.
- Detection validated against known injected patterns — explicitly **not** validated against real incidents, stated wherever results are shown.

**Cross-agent handoff (Occupancy → Security)**: any occupancy in a restricted zone (e.g. Server Room) triggers a real row in `security_alerts` tagged `source="occupancy_agent"`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Milestone 4 — Cost Optimization & Facility Intelligence</b> (Weeks 7–8) ✅</summary>

**Cost Optimization Agent** — two-part dataset, both disclosed:
- **Part A**: ~97 real BBMP (Bengaluru municipal corporation) capital-works tender records from a public civic-data portal — real titles, amounts, and categories. Two honest caveats stated in-code: source data names the issuing office (not the winning contractor), and tender dates are remapped onto the demo window with spacing preserved.
- **Part B**: ~212 records of cross-agent operational cost, *derived* from the other four agents' real processed data using disclosed, published-rate formulas (BESCOM-style time-of-day tariffs for energy, wear-severity-based repair cost for maintenance, FM services rate for occupancy, incident-response labor cost for security). Enforced by a test that this derived cost never leaks into other domain dashboards.
- **4 ML models compared honestly**: IsolationForest + LocalOutlierFactor for anomaly detection (8.1% flagged, 92.2% cross-model agreement — reported as unsupervised diagnostics since no labeled ground truth exists); GradientBoosting + RandomForest for a smoothed 3-week spend trend forecast (RandomForest won, **+20.7%** over naive baseline) — after an earlier attempt at forecasting raw weekly totals scored *worse* than naive, honestly reported as the reason the target was smoothed.

**Facility Intelligence Engine** — a thin, honest aggregation layer that never re-derives anything from the five agents, so it can't drift from what each dashboard already shows:
- `GET /api/facility/health` — composite 0–100 score, equal-weighted across all five domains, full breakdown included.
- `GET /api/facility/alerts` — unified alert feed across all agents.
- `GET /api/facility/kpis` — headline KPIs for the Executive dashboard.

**Frontend**: new `/executive` Overview dashboard (now the default landing page) — per-domain KPI row, Facility Health Score gauge, unified alert feed. All ₹ amounts render in lakh/crore notation.

## 📁 Data Sources & Honesty Notes

This project deliberately documents exactly which parts of every dataset are real, which are derived from real data via disclosed formulas, and which are synthetic — no result is presented as better-sourced than it actually is.

| Domain | Real source | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| Energy | PJM grid load, Environment Canada weather, UCI Occupancy | 3 real datasets, composited onto one timeline |
| Maintenance | NASA C-MAPSS (FD001) | Real sensor data, relabeled onto fictional assets |
| Occupancy | UCI Occupancy Detection | Real classifier training + real profile projected across a synthetic 8-zone fleet |
| Security | — | Fully synthetic, disclosed, with labeled injected anomalies |
| Cost | BBMP tender data (data.opencity.in) | Real capital-works records + formula-derived cross-agent operating cost |

See each milestone section above, or the relevant `build_*_dataset.py` script, for full detail.
